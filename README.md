# pong

Note: This is a work in progress.

A program I made to become familiar with lwjgl and to try using what I learned in linear algebra to create animations. It is a basic pong game set in space. There is a twist: when a player fails to hit the ball with its spaceship the spaceships will travel horizontally to catch up with the ball and keep playing. At the moment space just suddenly ends but the idea is that if a spaceship fails to hit the ball repeatedly and therefore moves too far it will get destroyed and the responsible player will loose the game.

At this moment there is no AI so the game is strictly two-player mode. The controls for the left player are 'W' and 'S' and the controls for the right player are 'Up' and 'Down'.

Enjoy!
